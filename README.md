# Catan Statistics

## Introduction

Catan Statistics is a small Laravel-based app to keep track of basic game history (who played, who won, dice rolls history).

This is a small pet project. We play a lot of Catan with friends and we often have comments such as "f**k the dice, it's just not fair" or "there were no sheep at all!", so I decided to start this project and be able to tell a bit more about the games played.

And, if nothing else, we'll know who is the best :)
